//! Support for the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller, which handles
//! basic I/O interrupts.  In multicore mode, we would apparently need to
//! replace this with an APIC interface.
//!
//! The basic idea here is that we have two PIC chips, PIC1 and PIC2, and
//! that PIC2 is slaved to interrupt 2 on PIC 1.  You can find the whole
//! story at http://wiki.osdev.org/PIC (as usual).  Basically, our
//! immensely sophisticated modern chipset is engaging in early-80s
//! cosplay, and our goal is to do the bare minimum required to get
//! reasonable interrupts.
//!
//! The most important thing we need to do here is set the base "offset"
//! for each of our two PICs, because by default, PIC1 has an offset of
//! 0x8, which means that the I/O interrupts from PIC1 will overlap
//! processor interrupts for things like "General Protection Fault".  Since
//! interrupts 0x00 through 0x1F are reserved by the processor, we move the
//! PIC1 interrupts to 0x20-0x27 and the PIC2 interrupts to 0x28-0x2F.  If
//! we wanted to write a DOS emulator, we'd presumably need to choose
//! different base interrupts, because DOS used interrupt 0x21 for system
//! calls.
